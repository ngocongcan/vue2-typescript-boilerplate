# Vue Boilerplates : vue2-typescript-boilerplate

> A vue.js project with  Vue2 + Typescript + Lazy loading and code splitting

## Why to choose Vue Boilerplates?
> While mobile-first approach becomes a standard and uncertain network conditions are something we should always take into consideration, it’s harder and harder to keep your application loading fast. Hence **Vue Boilerplates** are built with vue.js performance optimization techniques that make them loading instantly and perform smooth :rocket:.
